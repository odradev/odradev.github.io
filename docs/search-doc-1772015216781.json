Along with Krzysztof Pobiarżyn and Kuba Płaskonka, we formed an engineering team dedicated to smart contracts. Looking at the blockchain ecosystems from the smart contract developer perspective there are two universes. The first one is Solidity, which thrives and is at its best now. It has a ton of well-tested code and security tooling. Whenever an EVM-based blockchain pops out it gets populated by forks of DeFi and DAO protocols. Fascinating network effect emerges - code written for one EVM-based blockchain can be run on every other EVM-based blockchain. The second universe is Rust which compiles to WebAssembly. Here developer communities live in the guarded cities of Polkadot, Cosmos, Solana, Casper, and Near. The code written for one platform is not portable. The network effect never had a chance to arise. The main reason why Odra exists is achieving this cross-chain code reusability.

Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of smart contract development, enabling you to focus on writing your dapp without reinventing the wheel. It's free and open source. Odra's goal is to become the go-to smart contract framework for all WebAssembly-based blockchains. A smart contract written using Odra can be executed on all integrated systems. We can do it by abstracting over core concepts that all the above systems are built around. These are type system, storage, entry points, execution context, and testing environment. We believe it will bring standardization to the development of Rust-based smart contracts and enable code reusability we have not yet seen in this ecosystem. Let’s look at a Flipper contract, that holds a boolean value. The contract has a constructor that sets the initial value, and two entry points: flip() and get(), to change and query the current value, respectively. use odra::Variable; #[odra::module] pub struct Flipper { value: Variable&lt;bool&gt;, } #[odra::module] impl Flipper { #[odra(init)] pub fn init(&amp;mut self, value: bool) { self.value.set(value); } pub fn flip(&amp;mut self) { self.value.set(!self.get()); } pub fn get(&amp;self) -&gt; bool { self.value.get_or_default() } }  It comes with the CLI tool cargo-odra that makes it easy to use Odra.

In the realm of basic storage interaction, Odra provides several types for interacting with contract storage, including Var, Mapping, and List. These types enable contracts to store and retrieve data in a structured manner. The Var type is used to store a single value, while the List and Mapping types store collections of values. Var: A Var in Odra is a fundamental building block used for storing single values. Each Var is uniquely identified by its name in the contract. Mapping: Mapping in Odra serves as a key-value storage system. It stores an association of unique keys to values, and the value can be retrieved using the key. List: Built on top of the Var and Mapping building blocks, List in Odra allows storing an ordered collection of values that can be iterated over.

In previous examples, the value of the Mapping typically comprised a standard serializable type (such as number, string, or bool) or a custom type marked with the #[odra::odra_type] attribute. However, there are more advanced scenarios where the value of the Mapping represents a module itself. This approach is beneficial when managing a collection of modules, each maintaining its unique state. Let's consider the following example: examples/src/features/storage/mapping.rs use odra::casper_types::U256; use odra::prelude::*; use crate::owned_token::OwnedToken; #[odra::module] pub struct Mappings { strings: Mapping&lt;(String, u32, String), String&gt;, tokens: Mapping&lt;String, OwnedToken&gt; } #[odra::module] impl Mappings { ... pub fn total_supply(&amp;mut self, token_name: String) -&gt; U256 { self.tokens.module(&amp;token_name).total_supply() } pub fn get_string_api( &amp;self, key1: String, key2: u32, key3: String ) -&gt; String { let opt_string = self.strings.get(&amp;(key1, key2, key3)); opt_string.unwrap_or_revert(&amp;self.env()) } }  As you can see, a Mapping key can consist of a tuple of values, not limited to a single value. note Accessing Odra modules differs from accessing regular values such as strings or numbers. Firstly, within a Mapping, you don't encapsulate the module with Submodule. Secondly, rather than utilizing the Mapping::get() function, call Mapping::module(), which returns SubModule&lt;T&gt; and sets the appropriate namespace for nested modules.

Both languages emphasize strong typing, pattern matching, and immutability by default. Nysa performs Solidity-to-Rust transpilation through four simple steps.  Solidity Parser Firstly, we need a well-structured Rust representation of Solidity code. Nysa utilizes LALRPOP - a Rust parser generator framework. In the further steps, this enables us to conduct static analysis of the Solidity code, ranging from contract context down to individual expressions. solidity-parser/src/pt.rs // The representation of a Solidity contract #[derive(Debug, PartialEq)] pub struct ContractDefinition { pub doc: Vec&lt;DocComment&gt;, pub loc: Loc, pub ty: ContractTy, pub name: Identifier, pub base: Vec&lt;Base&gt;, pub parts: Vec&lt;ContractPart&gt;, }  C3 Linearization One of the most notable distinctions between Rust and Solidity is their approach to inheritance. Rust says No, thx, whereas Solidity opts for The more, the better. Speaking more technically, Solidity supports multiple inheritance with C3 linearization. info The primary purpose of the C3 Linearization Algorithm is to establish a consistent and unambiguous order of method resolution in cases where there might be ambiguity or conflicts due to multiple inheritance. It ensures that the inherited methods are called in a predictable and well-defined sequence based on the class hierarchy and the order in which classes are defined. For simulating C3 linearization, Nysa utilizes an implementation of the C3 linearization in Rust written by Maciej Zieliński, so everything stays in the Odra family. Nysa Parser After that, we step to the essential part, converting Solidity code into Rust code. For example, a Solidity event. event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value);  can easily be represented as an plain Rust struct - the same name, the same fields, similar types. #[derive(PartialEq, Eq, Debug)] pub struct Transfer { from: Option&lt;Address&gt;, to: Option&lt;Address&gt;, value: U256, }  The same we do with contracts, interfaces, libraries, errors, variables, functions, statements, etc. Here is a snippet of the expression parser: nysa/src/parser/odra/expr/mod.rs pub fn parse&lt;T&gt;(expression: &amp;Expression, ctx: &amp;mut T) -&gt; Result&lt;syn::Expr, ParserError&gt; where T: StorageInfo + TypeInfo + EventsRegister + ExternalCallsRegister + ContractInfo + FnContext, { match expression { Expression::Require { condition, error } =&gt; error::revert(Some(condition), error, ctx), Expression::ZeroAddress =&gt; Ok(parse_quote!(None)), Expression::Add { left, right } =&gt; math::add(left, right, ctx), Expression::Subtract { left, right } =&gt; math::sub(left, right, ctx), Expression::Increment { expr } =&gt; { let expr = parse(expr, ctx)?; Ok(parse_quote!(#expr += 1)) } Expression::ExternalCall { variable, fn_name, args, } =&gt; parse_ext_call(variable, fn_name, args, ctx), Expression::Type { ty } =&gt; { let ty = ty::parse_plain_type_from_ty(ty, ctx)?; Ok(parse_quote!(#ty)) } Expression::BoolLiteral(b) =&gt; Ok(parse_quote!(#b)), ... } }  Printing the code The last step is just consuming the resulting C3 AST.

To set up the project, we use cargo odra. cargo odra new -n status -t blank cd status  The first thing is to add Nysa to the project and create a rudimentary build.rs where we define the input - a solidity contract and the output - an Odra module generated by Nysa.

Following, let's define a lib.rs file. src/lib.rs mod status_message; pub use status_message::{StatusMessage, StatusMessageDeployer, StatusMessageRef}; #[cfg(test)] mod test;  The file is straightforward: registers a status_message rust module, reexports some Odra abstractions, and adds a test module. Lastly, we can test our contract. Like the original solidity contract, our Odra contract exposes two entry points: set_message() and get_message(). The test code looks like any other Odra test: we use StatusMessageDeployer to instantiate a contract, which gets us a reference to interact with the contract. src/test.rs use odra::{test_env, types::Address}; use super::*; const ACCOUNT: fn() -&gt; Address = || odra::test_env::get_account(1); #[test] fn set_get_message() { let mut contract = StatusMessageDeployer::default(); test_env::set_caller(ACCOUNT()); contract.set_status(&quot;hello&quot;.to_string()); assert_eq!(&quot;hello&quot;.to_string(), contract.get_status(Some(ACCOUNT()))); } #[test] fn get_nonexistent_message() { let contract = StatusMessageDeployer::default(); assert_eq!( String::new(), contract.get_status(Some(ACCOUNT())) ); }  cargo odra test # test against MockVM # or cargo odra test -b casper # build a wasm file and test against CasperVM  status-message ├── src │ ├── lib.rs │ ├── status_message.sol │ └── test.rs ├── build.rs ├── Cargo.toml └── Odra.toml  Full example available here.

We delegate various functions from both modules using the delegate! macro. As a result, the contract retains its succinctness without compromising on functionality. The above example basically merges the functionalities of modules and adds some control over the minting process. But you can use delegation to build more complex contracts, cherry-picking just a few module functionalities. Let's take a look at another example. use crate::{erc20::Erc20, ownable::Ownable, exchange::Exchange}; use odra::{casper_types::U256, prelude::*}; #[odra::module] pub struct DeFiPlatform { ownable: SubModule&lt;Ownable&gt;, erc20: SubModule&lt;Erc20&gt;, exchange: SubModule&lt;Exchange&gt; } #[odra::module] impl DeFiPlatform { pub fn init(&amp;mut self, name: String, symbol: String, decimals: u8, initial_supply: U256, exchange_rate: u64) { let deployer = self.env().caller(); self.ownable.init(deployer); self.erc20.init(name, symbol, decimals, initial_supply); self.exchange.init(exchange_rate); } delegate! { to self.erc20 { fn transfer(&amp;mut self, recipient: Address, amount: U256); fn balance_of(&amp;self, owner: Address) -&gt; U256; } to self.ownable { fn get_owner(&amp;self) -&gt; Address; } to self.exchange { fn swap(&amp;mut self, sender: Address, recipient: Address); fn set_exchange_rate(&amp;mut self, new_rate: u64); } } pub fn mint(&amp;mut self, address: Address, amount: U256) { self.ownable.ensure_ownership(self.env().caller()); self.erc20.mint(address, amount); } }  In this DeFiPlatform contract, we include Erc20, Ownable, and Exchange modules. By delegating functions from these modules, the parent contract becomes a powerhouse of functionality while retaining its readability and structure.

Here is an example of what the interface for reading and writing data could look like: pub trait CasperStorage { fn read(key: &amp;str) -&gt; Option&lt;Vec&lt;u8&gt;&gt;; fn write(key: &amp;str, value: Vec&lt;u8&gt;); }  ","version":"2.5.0","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Odra Perspective​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Storage Layout","url":"/docs/advanced/storage-layout#odra-perspective","content":"Odra was conceived with modularity and code reusability in mind.

The Token module can be reused in another module, as demonstrated in a more complex example: #[odra::module] pub struct Loans { lenders: SubModule&lt;Token&gt;, borrowers: SubModule&lt;Token&gt;, }  The Loans module has two fields: lenders and borrowers, both of which have the same storage layout as defined by the Token module.

While this may initially appear complex, it is easily understood through an example. In the example, indexes are presented as bytes, reflecting the actual implementation. Loans { lenders: Token { // prefix: 0x0001 name: 1, // key: 0x0001_0001 balances: 2 // key: 0x0001_0010 }, borrowers: Token { // prefix: 0x0010 name: 1, // key: 0x0010_0001 balances: 2 // key: 0x0010_0010 } }  Additionally, it's worth mentioning how Mapping's keys are used in thestorage.

For instance, triggering borrowers.balances.get(0x1234abcd) would result in a key: 0x0001_0001_1234_abcd  Finally, the key must be hashed to fit within the 64-character limit and then encoded in hexadecimal format.

The only way of doing that is by executing code in the sessions context, that top-ups the cargo_purse and then calls the contract. Odra provides a generic proxy_caller.wasm that does exactly that.

It serializes the data and stores it under a single key in the blockchain storage. To use it, just wrap your variable in the Var type. Let's look at a &quot;real world&quot; example of a contract that represents a dog: examples/src/features/storage/variable.rs use odra::prelude::*; #[odra::module] pub struct DogContract { barks: Var&lt;bool&gt;, weight: Var&lt;u32&gt;, name: Var&lt;String&gt;, walks: Var&lt;Vec&lt;u32&gt;&gt;, }  You can see the Var wrapping the data. Even complex types like Vec can be wrapped (with some caveats)! Let's make this contract usable, by providing a constructor and some getter functions: examples/src/features/storage/variable.rs #[odra::module] impl DogContract { pub fn init(&amp;mut self, barks: bool, weight: u32, name: String) { self.barks.set(barks); self.weight.set(weight); self.name.set(name); self.walks.set(Vec::&lt;u32&gt;::default()); } pub fn barks(&amp;self) -&gt; bool { self.barks.get_or_default() } pub fn weight(&amp;self) -&gt; u32 { self.weight.get_or_default() } pub fn name(&amp;self) -&gt; String { self.name.get_or_default() } pub fn walks_amount(&amp;self) -&gt; u32 { let walks = self.walks.get_or_default(); walks.len() as u32 } pub fn walks_total_length(&amp;self) -&gt; u32 { let walks = self.walks.get_or_default(); walks.iter().sum() } }  As you can see, you can access the data, by using get_or_default function: examples/src/features/storage/variable.rs ... self.barks.get_or_default() ...  note Keep in mind that using get() will result in an Option that you'll need to unwrap - the variable doesn't have to be initialized! To modify the data, use the set() function: examples/src/features/storage/variable.rs self.barks.set(barks);  A Var is easy to use and efficient for simple data types. One of its downsides is that it serializes the data as a whole, so when you're using complex types like Vec or HashMap, each time you get or set the whole data is read and written to the blockchain storage. In the example above, if we want to see how many walks our dog had, we would use the function: examples/src/features/storage/variable.rs pub fn walks_amount(&amp;self) -&gt; usize { let walks = self.walks.get_or_default(); walks.len() }  But to do so, we need to extract the whole serialized vector from the storage, which would inefficient, especially for larger sets of data. To tackle this issue following two types were created. ","version":"2.5.0","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Mapping​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Storage interaction","url":"/docs/basics/storage-interaction#mapping","content":"The Mapping is used to store and access data as key-value pairs. To define a Mapping, you need to pass two values - the key type and the value type. Let's look at the variation of the Dog contract, that uses Mapping to store information about our dog's friends and how many times they visited: examples/src/features/storage/mapping.rs use odra::prelude::*; #[odra::module] pub struct DogContract2 { name: Var&lt;String&gt;, friends: Mapping&lt;String, u32&gt;, }  In the example above, our key is a String (it is a name of the friend) and we are storing u32 values (amount of visits). To read and write values from and into a Mapping we use a similar approach to the one shown in the Vars section with one difference - we need to pass a key: examples/src/features/storage/mapping.rs pub fn visit(&amp;mut self, friend_name: String) { let visits = self.visits(friend_name.clone()); self.friends.set(&amp;friend_name, visits + 1); } pub fn visits(&amp;self, friend_name: String) -&gt; u32 { self.friends.get_or_default(&amp;friend_name) }  The biggest improvement over a Var is that we can model functionality of a HashMap using Mapping. The amount of data written to and read from the storage is minimal. However, we cannot iterate over Mapping. We could implement such behavior by using a numeric type key and saving the length of the set in a separate variable. Thankfully Odra comes with a prepared solution - the List type. note If you take a look into List implementation in Odra, you'll see that in fact it is just a Mapping with a Var working together: core/src/list.rs use odra::prelude::*; pub struct List&lt;T&gt; { values: Mapping&lt;u32, T&gt;, index: Var&lt;u32&gt; }  ","version":"2.5.0","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"List​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Storage interaction","url":"/docs/basics/storage-interaction#list","content":"Going back to our DogContract example - let's revisit the walk case. This time, instead of Vec, we'll use the list: examples/src/features/storage/list.rs use odra::prelude::*; #[odra::module] pub struct DogContract3 { name: Var&lt;String&gt;, walks: List&lt;u32&gt;, }  As you can see, the notation is very similar to the Vec. To understand the usage, take a look at the reimplementation of the functions with an additional function that takes our dog for a walk (it writes the data to the storage): examples/src/features/storage/list.rs #[odra::module] impl DogContract3 { pub fn init(&amp;mut self, name: String) { self.name.set(name); } pub fn name(&amp;self) -&gt; String { self.name.get_or_default() } pub fn walks_amount(&amp;self) -&gt; u32 { self.walks.len() } pub fn walks_total_length(&amp;self) -&gt; u32 { self.walks.iter().sum() } pub fn walk_the_dog(&amp;mut self, length: u32) { self.walks.push(length); } }  Now, we can know how many walks our dog had without loading the whole vector from the storage. We need to do this to sum the length of all the walks, but the Odra framework cannot (yet) handle all the cases for you. info All of the above examples, alongside the tests, are available in the Odra repository in the examples/src/features/ folder.

It is an exposed entry point and an important building block widely used throughout the entire module.L48 - This is a non-exported block containing helper functions.L49-L53 - The check_role() function serves as a guard function. Before a Role is granted or revoked, we must ensure that the caller is allowed to do so. For this purpose, the function reads the roles mapping. If the role has not been granted to the address, the contract reverts with Error::MissingRole.L55-L63 - The set_admin_role() function simply updates the role_admin mapping and emits the RoleAdminChanged event.L65-L85 - The unchecked_grant_role() and unchecked_revoke_role() functions are mirror functions that update the roles mapping and post RoleGranted or RoleRevoked events. If the role is already granted, unchecked_grant_role() has no effect (the opposite check is made in the case of revoking a role).L21-L28 - The get_role_admin() entry point reads the role_admin. If there is no admin role for a given role, it returns the default role.L30-L45 - This is a combination of check_role() and unchecked_*_role(). Entry points fail on unauthorized access.

The changes will depend on the specific features and APIs used in the contracts. Here are some common changes you might need to make: 2.3.1. Update the use statements to reflect the new module structure.​ Big integer types are now located in the odra::casper_types module.odra::types::Address is now odra::Address.Variable is now Var.Remove odra::contract_env.Remove odra::types::event::OdraEvent.Remove odra::types::OdraType as it is no longer required.Change odra::types::casper_types::*; to odra::casper_types::*;. 2.3.2. Some type aliases are no longer in use.​ Balance - use odra::casper_types::U512.BlockTime - use u64.EventData - use odra::casper_types::bytesrepr::Bytes. 2.3.3. Consider import odra::prelude::* in your module files.​ 2.3.4. Flatten nested Mappings.​ // Before #[odra::module(events = [Approval, Transfer])] pub struct Erc20 { ... allowances: Mapping&lt;Address, Mapping&lt;Address, U256&gt;&gt; } // After #[odra::module(events = [Approval, Transfer])] pub struct Erc20 { ... allowances: Mapping&lt;(Address, Address), U256&gt; }  2.3.5. Update errors definitions.​ execution_error! macro has been replace with OdraError derive macro. 0.8.0Prev use odra::OdraError; #[derive(OdraError)] pub enum Error { InsufficientBalance = 30_000, InsufficientAllowance = 30_001, NameNotSet = 30_002, SymbolNotSet = 30_003, DecimalsNotSet = 30_004 }  2.3.6. Update events definitions.​ 0.8.0Prev use odra::prelude::*; use odra::Event; #[derive(Event, Eq, PartialEq, Debug)] pub struct Transfer { pub from: Option&lt;Address&gt;, pub to: Option&lt;Address&gt;, pub amount: U256 } // Emitting the event self.env().emit_event(Transfer { from: None, to: Some(*address), amount: *amount });  2.3.7. Replace contract_env with self.env() in your modules.​ self.env() is a new way to access the contract environment, returns a reference to ContractEnv. The API is similar to the previous contract_env but with some changes. fn get_var&lt;T: FromBytes&gt;(key: &amp;[u8]) -&gt; Option&lt;T&gt; is now fn get_value&lt;T: FromBytes&gt;(&amp;self, key: &amp;[u8]) -&gt; Option&lt;T&gt;.fn set_var&lt;T: CLTyped + ToBytes&gt;(key: &amp;[u8], value: T) is now fn set_value&lt;T: ToBytes + CLTyped&gt;(&amp;self, key: &amp;[u8], value: T).set_dict_value() and get_dict_value() has been removed. All the dictionary operations should be performed using Mapping type, internally using set_var() and get_var() functions. fn hash&lt;T: AsRef&lt;[u8]&gt;&gt;(input: T) -&gt; Vec&lt;u8&gt; is now fn hash&lt;T: ToBytes&gt;(&amp;self, value: T) -&gt; [u8; 32].fn revert&lt;E: Into&lt;ExecutionError&gt;&gt;(error: E) -&gt; ! is now fn revert&lt;E: Into&lt;OdraError&gt;&gt;(&amp;self, error: E) -&gt; !.fn emit_event&lt;T: ToBytes + OdraEvent&gt;(event: T) is now fn emit_event&lt;T: ToBytes&gt;(&amp;self, event: T).fn call_contract&lt;T: CLTyped + FromBytes&gt;(address: Address, entrypoint: &amp;str, args: &amp;RuntimeArgs, amount: Option&lt;U512&gt;) -&gt; T is now fn call_contract&lt;T: FromBytes&gt;(&amp;self, address: Address, call: CallDef) -&gt; T.functions native_token_metadata() and one_token() have been removed. 2.3.8. Wrap submodules of your module with odra::SubModule&lt;T&gt;.​ 0.8.0Prev #[odra::module(events = [Transfer])] pub struct Erc721Token { core: SubModule&lt;Erc721Base&gt;, metadata: SubModule&lt;Erc721MetadataExtension&gt;, ownable: SubModule&lt;Ownable&gt; }  2.3.9. Update external contract calls.​ However the definition of an external contract remains the same, the way you call it has changed. A reference to an external contract is named {{ModuleName}}ContractRef (former {{ModuleName}}Ref) and you can call it using {{ModuleName}}ContractRef::new(env, address) (former {{ModuleName}}Ref::at()). 0.8.0Prev #[odra::external_contract] pub trait Token { fn balance_of(&amp;self, owner: &amp;Address) -&gt; U256; } // Usage TokenContractRef::new(env, token).balance_of(account)  2.3.10. Update constructors.​ Remove the #[odra::init] attribute from the constructor and ensure that the constructor function is named init. 2.3.11. Update UnwrapOrRevert calls.​ The functions unwrap_or_revert and unwrap_or_revert_with now require &amp;HostEnv as the first parameter. 2.3.12. Remove #[odra(using)] attribute from your module definition.​ Sharing the same instance of a module is no longer supported. A redesign of the module structure might be required.

Update Tests​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Migration guide to v0.8.0","url":"/docs/migrations/to-0.8.0#24-update-tests","content":"Once you've updated your smart contracts, you'll need to update your tests to reflect the changes. The changes will depend on the specific features and APIs used in the tests. Here are some common changes you might need to make: 2.4.1. Contract deployment.​ The way you deploy a contract has changed: You should use {{ModuleName}}HostRef::deploy(&amp;env, args) instead of {{ModuleName}}Deployer::init(). The {{ModuleName}}HostRef implements odra::host::Deployer.Instantiate the HostEnv using odra_test::env(), required by the odra::host::Deployer::deploy() function.If the contract doesn't have init args, you should use odra::host::NoArgs as the second argument of the deploy function.If the contract has init args, you should pass the autogenerated {{ModuleName}}InitArgs as the second argument of the deploy function. 0.8.0Prev // A contract without init args use super::OwnableHostRef; use odra::host::{Deployer, HostEnv, HostRef, NoArgs}; let env: HostEnv = odra_test::env(); let ownable = OwnableHostRef::deploy(&amp;env, NoArgs) // A contract with init args use super::{Erc20HostRef, Erc20InitArgs}; use odra::host::{Deployer, HostEnv}; let env: HostEnv = odra_test::env(); let init_args = Erc20InitArgs { symbol: SYMBOL.to_string(), name: NAME.to_string(), decimals: DECIMALS, initial_supply: Some(INITIAL_SUPPLY.into()) }; let erc20 = Erc20HostRef::deploy(&amp;env, init_args);  2.4.2. Host interactions.​ Replace odra::test_env with odra_test::env().The API of odra::test_env and odra_test::env() are similar, but there are some differences: test_env::advance_block_time_by(BlockTime) is now env.advance_block_time(u64).test_env::token_balance(Address) is now env.balance_of(&amp;Address).functions test_env::last_call_contract_gas_cost(), test_env::last_call_contract_gas_used(), test_env::total_gas_used(Address), test_env::gas_report() have been removed. You should use HostRef::last_call() and extract the data from a odra::ContractCallResult instance. HostRef is a trait implemented by {{ModuleName}}HostRef. 2.4.3. Testing failing scenarios.​ test_env::assert_exception() has been removed. You should use the try_ prefix to call the function and then assert the result.try_ prefix is a new way to call a function that might fail. It returns a OdraResult type, which you can then assert using the standard Rust assert_eq! macro. 0.8.0Prev #[test] fn transfer_from_error() { let (env, mut erc20) = setup(); let (owner, spender, recipient) = (env.get_account(0), env.get_account(1), env.get_account(2)); let amount = 1_000.into(); env.set_caller(spender); assert_eq!( erc20.try_transfer_from(owner, recipient, amount), Err(Error::InsufficientAllowance.into()) ); }  2.4.4. Testing events.​ assert_events! macro has been removed. You should use HostEnv::emitted_event() to assert the emitted events. The new API doesn't allow to assert multiple events at once, but adds alternative ways to assert the emitted events. Check the HostEnv documentation to explore the available options. 0.8.0Prev let env: HostEnv = odra_test::env(); let erc20 = Erc20HostRef::deploy(&amp;env, init_args); ... assert!(env.emitted_event( erc20.address(), &amp;Approval { owner, spender, value: approved_amount - transfer_amount } )); assert!(env.emitted_event( erc20.address(), &amp;Transfer { from: Some(owner), to: Some(recipient), amount: transfer_amount } ));  ","version":"2.5.0","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"3.

","version":"2.5.0","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Voting mechanism​","type":1,"pageTitle":"CEP-18","url":"/docs/tutorials/cep18#voting-mechanism","content":"Our voting system will be straightforward: Anyone with the tokens can propose a new mint.Anyone with the tokens can vote for the new mint by staking their tokens.If the majority of the token holders vote for the mint, it is executed. Storage​ We will need to store some additional information about the votes, so let's add some fields to our token struct: src/token.rs #[odra::module] pub struct OurToken { /// A sub-module that implements the CEP-18 token standard. token: SubModule&lt;Cep18&gt;, /// The proposed mint. proposed_mint: Var&lt;(Address, U256)&gt;, /// The list of votes cast in the current vote. votes: List&lt;Ballot&gt;, /// Whether a vote is open. is_vote_open: Var&lt;bool&gt;, /// The time when the vote ends. vote_end_time: Var&lt;u64&gt;, } /// A ballot cast by a voter. #[odra::odra_type] struct Ballot { voter: Address, choice: bool, amount: U256, }  Notice that proposed_mint contains a tuple containing the address of the proposer and the amount of tokens to mint. Moreover, we need to keep track if the vote time has ended, but also if it was already tallied, that's why we need both is_vote_open and vote_end_time. We will also use the power of the Listtype to store the Ballots. Proposing a new mint​ To implement the endpoint that allows token holders to propose a new mint, we need to add a new function to our token module: src/token.rs /// Proposes a new mint for the contract. pub fn propose_new_mint(&amp;mut self, account: Address, amount: U256) { // Only allow proposing a new mint if there is no vote in progress. if self.is_vote_open().get_or_default() { self.env().revert(GovernanceError::VoteAlreadyOpen); } // Only the token holders can propose a new mint. if self.balance_of(&amp;self.env().caller()) == U256::zero() { self.env().revert(GovernanceError::OnlyTokenHoldersCanPropose); } // Set the proposed mint. self.proposed_mint.set((account, amount)); // Open a vote. self.is_vote_open.set(true); // Set the vote end time to 10 minutes from now. self.vote_end_time .set(self.env().get_block_time() + 60 * 10 * 1000); }  As a parameters to the function, we pass the address of the account that should be the receiver of the minted tokens, and the amount. After some validation, we open the vote by setting the is_vote_open to true, and setting the vote_end_time to 10 minutes. In real-world scenarios, the time could be configurable, but for the sake of simplicity, we hardcoded it. Also, it should be quite longer than 10 minutes, but it will come in handy when we test it on Livenet. Voting for the mint​ Next, we need an endpoint that will allow us to cast a ballot: src/token.rs /// Votes on the proposed mint. pub fn vote(&amp;mut self, choice: bool, amount: U256) { // Only allow voting if there is a vote in progress. self.assert_vote_in_progress(); let voter = self.env().caller(); let contract = self.env().self_address(); // Transfer the voting tokens from the voter to the contract. self.token .transfer(&amp;contract, &amp;amount); // Add the vote to the list. self.votes.push(Ballot { voter, choice, amount, }); }  The most interesting thing here is that we are using a mechanism of staking, where we transfer our tokens to the contract, to show that we really mean it. The tokens will be locked until the vote is over, and tallied. Speaking of tallying... Tallying the votes​ The last step is to tally the votes and mint the tokens if the majority of voters agreed to do so: src/token.rs /// Count the votes and perform the action pub fn tally(&amp;mut self) { // Only allow tallying the votes once. if !self.is_vote_open.get_or_default() { self.env().revert(GovernanceError::NoVoteInProgress); } // Only allow tallying the votes after the vote has ended. let finish_time = self .vote_end_time .get_or_revert_with(GovernanceError::NoVoteInProgress); if self.env().get_block_time() &lt; finish_time { self.env().revert(GovernanceError::VoteNotYetEnded); } // Count the votes let mut yes_votes = U256::zero(); let mut no_votes = U256::zero(); let contract = self.env().self_address(); while let Some(vote) = self.votes.pop() { if vote.choice { yes_votes += vote.amount; } else { no_votes += vote.amount; } // Transfer back the voting tokens to the voter. self.token.raw_transfer(&amp;contract, &amp;vote.voter, &amp;vote.amount); } // Perform the action if the vote has passed. if yes_votes &gt; no_votes { let (account, amount) = self .proposed_mint .get_or_revert_with(GovernanceError::NoVoteInProgress); self.token.raw_mint(&amp;account, &amp;amount); } // Close the vote. self.is_vote_open.set(false); }  Notice how we used raw_transfer from the Cep18 module. We used it to set the sender, so the contract's balance will be used, instead of the caller's. Additonally, we used raw_mint to mint the tokens, skipping the security checks. We have no modality for minting, but even if we had, we don't have anyone with permissions! The Contract needs to mint the tokens itself.

It is used to deploy the contract to the network and store the address of the deployed contract in a container for later use. Only one deploy script can be used in a single CLI tool, and it is executed when the user runs the deploy command. bin/odra-cli.rs use odra::host::HostEnv; use odra_cli::{ deploy::DeployScript, DeployerExt, DeployedContractsContainer, }; use odra_examples::features::storage::variable::{DogContract, DogContractInitArgs}; /// Deploys the `DogContract` and adds it to the container. pub struct DeployDogScript; impl DeployScript for DeployDogScript { fn deploy( &amp;self, env: &amp;HostEnv, container: &amp;mut DeployedContractsContainer ) -&gt; Result&lt;(), odra_cli::deploy::Error&gt; { env.set_gas(350_000_000_000); let dog_contract = DogContract::try_deploy( env, DogContractInitArgs { barks: true, weight: 10, name: &quot;Mantus&quot;.to_string() } )?; container.add_contract(&amp;dog_contract)?; // By default, a contract is non-upgradeable, you can change it by passing `InstallConfig` _ = DogContract::try_deploy_with_cfg( env, DogContractInitArgs { barks: true, weight: 10, name: &quot;Mantus&quot;.to_string() }, InstallConfig::upgradable::&lt;DogContract&gt;(), )?; // Alternatively, you can use the `DeployerExt` trait to deploy the contract: _ = DogContract::load_or_deploy( env, DogContractInitArgs { barks: true, weight: 10, name: &quot;Mantus&quot;.to_string() }, container, 350_000_000_000 )?; // You can use `load_or_deploy_with_cfg` to deploy the contract with a custom configuration _ = DogContract::load_or_deploy_with_cfg( env, DogContractInitArgs { barks: true, weight: 10, name: &quot;Mantus&quot;.to_string() }, InstallConfig::upgradable::&lt;DogContract&gt;(), container, 350_000_000_000 )?; Ok(()) } }  In the example above, we see a few alternative implementations of a simple DeployScript for our DogContract. All of them set the gas limit, deploy the contract and adds it to a container. DogContract::try_deploy method, which deploys the contract every time the script is run. DogContract::try_deploy_with_cfg also deploys a contract everytime, but passes [InstallConfig] instance to configure the deployment using a factory method InstallConfig::upgradable.Utilizes the [DeployerExt] trait, which checks if the contract is already deployed and returns the existing instance if it is, or deploys it if it is not. It is a convenient way to ensure that the contract is deployed only once. It is useful when you want to add more contracts to the script in the future and avoid redeploying previously deployed contracts. The last option is to use DeployerExt::load_or_deploy_with_cfg that works like the previous one, but accepts a custom configuration. The address of the deployed contract is stored in a TOML file in the resources directory, which is created automatically by the Odra CLI library. ","version":"2.5.0","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Scenarios​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Odra CLI","url":"/docs/tutorials/odra-cli#scenarios","content":"Scenarios are a way to run multiple calls one after another, and can be used to test the contract or perform complex operations like setting up the dependencies between contracts. To create a scenario, you need to implement the Scenario trait and add it to the OdraCli instance in the main function. A scenario also implements the ScenarioMetadata trait, which provides metadata about the scenario, such as its name and description. You can use this metadata to display the scenario in the CLI tool and provide a description of what it does. bin/odra-cli.rs use odra_cli::{ scenario::{Args, Error, Scenario, ScenarioMetadata}, CommandArg, ContractProvider, DeployedContractsContainer, }; use std::vec; pub struct DogCheckScenario; impl Scenario for DogCheckScenario { fn args(&amp;self) -&gt; Vec&lt;CommandArg&gt; { vec![CommandArg::new( &quot;name&quot;, &quot;The name of the dog&quot;, NamedCLType::String, ).required()] } fn run( &amp;self, env: &amp;HostEnv, container: &amp;DeployedContractsContainer, args: Args ) -&gt; Result&lt;(), Error&gt; { let dog_contract = container.contract_ref::&lt;DogContract&gt;(env)?; let test_name = args.get_single::&lt;String&gt;(&quot;name&quot;)?; env.set_gas(50_000_000); let actual_name = dog_contract.try_name()?; assert_eq!(test_name, actual_name, &quot;Dog name mismatch&quot;); Ok(()) } } impl ScenarioMetadata for DogCheckScenario { const NAME: &amp;'static str = &quot;check&quot;; const DESCRIPTION: &amp;'static str = &quot;Checks if the name of the deployed dog matches the provided name&quot;; }  A scenario must implement the Scenario trait, which requires defining the args and run methods. The args method returns a vector of CommandArg that defines the arguments that the scenario accepts. In this case, we define a single argument name of type String, which is required - the program will fail at parse time if the argument is not provided. The run method is where the scenario logic is implemented. It receives the HostEnv, a container with deployed contracts, and the arguments passed to the scenario. To load the contract, we use the ContractProvider trait, which allows us to get a reference to the contract by its type. The trait is implemented for the DeployedContractsContainer, which is passed to the run method. To read the arguments, we use the Args type, which provides two methods: get_single and get_many. In this case, we use get_single to get the value of the name argument. If we want to get multiple values for an argument, we must define the argument as CommandArg::new(&quot;name&quot;, &quot;The name of the dog&quot;, NamedCLType::String).list(), where list() indicates that the argument can be provided multiple times. The example above performs a simple check on the return value of one of the methods. Of course, there is no limit to how complex a scenario can be.

TicketStatus enum represents the status of a ticket, TicketInfo struct contains information about a ticket that is written to the storage, TicketId is a type alias for u64. OnTicketIssue and OnTicketSell are events that will be emitted when a ticket is issued or sold.L41-L44 - Register errors and events that will be used in our contract, required to produce a complete contract schema.L45-L51 - TicketOffice module definition. The module contains a Cep95 token, an Ownable module, a Mapping that stores information about tickets and Vars token_id_counter and total_supply to keep track of the total number of tickets issued.L55-L59 - The init function has been generated from the template and there is no need to modify it, except the Ownable module initialization.L61-L84 - The issue_ticket function allows the owner to issue a new ticket. The function mints a new token, stores information about the ticket, and emits an OnTicketIssue event.L86 - The payable attribute indicates that the buy_ticket function can receive funds.L87-L116 - The buy_ticket function checks if the ticket is available for sale, if the buyer sends enough funds, and transfers the ticket to the buyer. Finally, the function updates the ticket status and emits an OnTicketSell event. Lets test the contract. The test scenario will be as follows: Deploy the contract.Issue two tickets.Try to buy a ticket with insufficient funds.Buy tickets.Try to buy the same ticket again.Check the balance of the contract. src/tests.rs use odra::{ casper_types::U512, host::{Deployer, HostRef}, }; use crate::token::{Error, TicketOfficeHostRef, TicketOfficeInitArgs}; #[test] fn it_works() { let env = odra_test::env(); let init_args = TicketOfficeInitArgs { collection_name: &quot;Ticket&quot;.to_string(), collection_symbol: &quot;T&quot;.to_string(), total_supply: 100, }; let mut contract = TicketOffice::deploy(&amp;env, init_args); contract.issue_ticket(&quot;Ev&quot;.to_string(), U512::from(100)); contract.issue_ticket(&quot;Ev&quot;.to_string(), U512::from(50)); let buyer = env.get_account(1); env.set_caller(buyer); assert_eq!( contract .with_tokens(U512::from(50)) .try_buy_ticket(0.into()), Err(Error::InsufficientFunds.into()) ); assert_eq!( contract .with_tokens(U512::from(100)) .try_buy_ticket(0.into()), Ok(()) ); assert_eq!( contract .with_tokens(U512::from(50)) .try_buy_ticket(1.into()), Ok(()) ); assert_eq!( contract .with_tokens(U512::from(100)) .try_buy_ticket(0.into()), Err(Error::TicketNotAvailableForSale.into()) ); }  Unfortunately, the test failed. The first assertion succeeds because the buyer sends insufficient funds to buy the ticket. However, the second assertion fails even though the buyer sends enough funds to purchase the ticket. The buy_ticket function reverts with CEP-95 Error::NotAnOwnerOrApproved because the buyer attempts to transfer a token that they do not own, are not approved for, or are not an operator of. odra/modules/src/cep95.rs fn transfer_from(&amp;mut self, from: Address, to: Address, token_id: U256) { self.assert_exists(&amp;token_id); let caller = self.env().caller(); let owner = self .owner_of(token_id) .unwrap_or_revert_with(self, Error::ValueNotSet); // Only the owner or an approved spender can transfer the token. if (owner != from || owner != caller) &amp;&amp; !self.is_approved_for_all(from, caller) { if let Some(approved) = self.approved_for(token_id) { if approved != caller { self.env().revert(Error::NotAnOwnerOrApproved); } } else { self.env().revert(Error::NotAnOwnerOrApproved); } } ... }  Let's fix it by redesigning our little system.

The function forwards the call to the ticketing office contract. We simply create a TicketOfficeContractRef to interact we the TicketOffice contract. Note that, the operator's buy_ticket now receives funds. Now we need to adjust the TicketOffice contract to use the TicketOperator contract to buy tickets. src/token.rs #[odra::odra_error] pub enum Error { ...

Also calls the register entry point on the operator contract.L32-36 - modify the issue_ticket function: once a new token is minted, approves the operator to transfer the ticket later.L40-L53 - modify the buy_ticket function: check if the caller is the operator, do not transfer cspr to the contract - now the operator collect funds.We also added two helper functions: is_operator and operator to check if the caller is the operator and get the operator address. Two new errors were added: MissingOperator and Unauthorized. Now we need to update our tests to create a scenario we presented in the sequence diagram. src/tests.rs use odra::{ casper_types::U512, host::{Deployer, HostRef, NoArgs}, prelude::* }; use crate::{ ticket_operator::TicketOperatorHostRef, token::{Error, TicketId, TicketOfficeContractRef, TicketOfficeInitArgs}, }; #[test] fn it_works() { let env = odra_test::env(); let init_args = TicketOfficeInitArgs { collection_name: &quot;Ticket&quot;.to_string(), collection_symbol: &quot;T&quot;.to_string(), total_supply: 100, }; let operator = TicketOperator::deploy(&amp;env, NoArgs); let mut ticket_office = TicketOfficeContractRef::deploy(&amp;env, init_args); ticket_office.register_operator(operator.address().clone()); ticket_office.issue_ticket(&quot;Ev&quot;.to_string(), U512::from(100)); ticket_office.issue_ticket(&quot;Ev&quot;.to_string(), U512::from(50)); let buyer = env.get_account(1); env.set_caller(buyer); assert_eq!( buy_ticket(&amp;operator, 0.into(), 50), Err(Error::InsufficientFunds.into()) ); assert_eq!(buy_ticket(&amp;operator, 0.into(), 100), Ok(())); assert_eq!(buy_ticket(&amp;operator, 1.into(), 50), Ok(())); assert_eq!( buy_ticket(&amp;operator, 0.into(), 100), Err(Error::TicketNotAvailableForSale.into()) ); assert_eq!(operator.balance_of(), U512::from(150)); } fn buy_ticket(operator: &amp;TicketOperatorHostRef, id: TicketId, price: u64) -&gt; OdraResult&lt;()&gt; { operator.with_tokens(U512::from(price)).try_buy_ticket(id) }  ","version":"2.5.0","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Conclusion​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Ticketing System","url":"/docs/tutorials/nft#conclusion","content":"In this tutorial, we created a simple ticketing system using the CEP-95 standard.

L3 - Firstly, we need to create a struct called Ownable and apply #[odra::module(events = [OwnershipChanged])] attribute to it. The events attribute is optional but informs the Odra toolchain about the events that will be emitted by the module and includes them in the contract's metadata. OwnershipChanged is a type that will be defined later.L5 - Then we can define the layout of our module. It is extremely simple - just a single state value. What is most important is that you can never leave a raw type; you must always wrap it with Var.

This matters if we would like to deploy the Ownable module as a standalone contract.L17-L20 - Before we set a new owner, we must assert there was no owner before and raise an error otherwise. For that purpose, we defined an Error enum. Notice that the #[odra::odra_error] attribute is applied to the enum. It generates, among others, the required Into&lt;odra::OdraError&gt; binding.L4-L6 - If the owner has been set already, we call ContractEnv::revert() function with an Error::OwnerIsAlreadyInitialized argument. L8 - Then we write the owner passed as an argument to the storage. To do so, we call the set() on Var.L22-L26 - Once the owner is set, we would like to inform the outside world. The first step is to define an event struct. The struct annotated with #[odra::event] attribute.L10 - Finally, call ContractEnv::emit_event() passing the OwnershipChanged instance to the function. Hence, we set the first owner, we set the prev_owner value to None.  ","version":"2.5.0","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Features implementation​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Ownable","url":"/docs/tutorials/ownable#features-implementation","content":"ownable.rs #[odra::module] impl Ownable { ... pub fn ensure_ownership(&amp;self, address: &amp;Address) { if Some(address) != self.owner.get_or_default().as_ref() { self.env().revert(Error::NotOwner) } } pub fn change_ownership(&amp;mut self, new_owner: &amp;Address) { self.ensure_ownership(&amp;self.env().caller()); let current_owner = self.get_owner(); self.owner.set(Some(*new_owner)); self.env().emit_event(OwnershipChanged { prev_owner: Some(current_owner), new_owner: *new_owner }); } pub fn get_owner(&amp;self) -&gt; Address { match self.owner.get_or_default() { Some(owner) =&gt; owner, None =&gt; self.env().revert(Error::OwnerIsNotInitialized) } } } #[odra::odra_error] pub enum Error { NotOwner = 1, OwnerIsAlreadyInitialized = 2, OwnerIsNotInitialized = 3, }  The above implementation relies on the concepts we have already used in this tutorial, so it should be easy for you to get along. L7,L31 - ensure_ownership() reads the current owner and reverts if it does not match the input Address. Also, we need to update our Error enum by adding a new variant NotOwner.L11 - The function defined above can be reused in the change_ownership() implementation. We pass to it the current caller, using the ContractEnv::caller() function. Then we update the state and emit OwnershipChanged.L21,L33 - Lastly, a getter function. Read the owner from storage, if the getter is called on an uninitialized module, it should revert with a new Error variant OwnerIsNotInitialized. There is one worth-mentioning subtlety: Var::get() function returns Option&lt;T&gt;. If the type implements the Default trait, you can call the get_or_default() function, and the contract does not fail even if the value is not initialized. As the owner is of type Option&lt;Address&gt; the Var::get() would return Option&lt;Option&lt;Address&gt;&gt;, we use Var::get_or_default() instead.

Take a look at the signature: fn setup() -&gt; (OwnableHostRef, HostEnv, Address). OwnableHostRef is a contract reference generated by Odra. This reference allows us to call all the defined entrypoints, namely: ensure_ownership(), change_ownership(), get_owner(), but not init(), which is a constructor.L7-L11 - The starting point of every test is getting an instance of HostEnv by calling odra_test::env(). Our function returns a triple: a contract ref, an env, and an address (the initial owner). Odra's #[odra::module] attribute implements a odra::host::Deployer for Ownable, and OwnableInitArgs that we pass as the second argument of the odra::host::Deployer::deploy() function. Lastly, the module needs an owner. The easiest way is to take one from the HostEnv. We choose the address of first account (which is the default one). L14 - It is time to define the first test. As you see, it is a regular Rust test.L16-17 - Using the setup() function, we get the owner and a reference (in this test, we don't use the env, so we ignore it). We make a standard assertion, comparing the owner we know with the value returned from the contract. note You may have noticed, we use here the term module interchangeably with contract. The reason is once we deploy our module onto a virtual blockchain it may be considered a contract. L19-25 - On the contract, only the init() function has been called, so we expect one event to have been emitted. To assert that, let's use HostEnv. To get the env, we call env() on the contract, then call HostEnv::emitted_event. As the first argument, pass the contract you want to read events from, followed by an event as you expect it to have occurred.L31 - Because we know the initial owner is the 0th account, we must select a different account. It could be any index from 1 to 19 - the HostEnv predefines 20 accounts.L33 - As mentioned, the default is the 0th account, if you want to change the executor, call the HostEnv::set_caller() function. note The caller switch applies only the next contract interaction, the second call will be done as the default account. L46-55 - If a non-owner account tries to change ownership, we expect it to fail. To capture the error, call HostEnv::try_change_ownership() instead of HostEnv::change_ownership(). HostEnv provides try_ functions for each contract's entrypoint. The try functions return OdraResult (an alias for Result&lt;T, OdraError&gt;) instead of panicking and halting the execution. In our case, we expect the contract to revert with the Error::NotOwner error. To compare the error, we use the Error::into() function, which converts the error into the OdraError type.

We will skip the details of the contract implementation and focus on the deployment and upgrade process. Our example deploys a simple counter contract making it upgradable and then upgrades it twice: first to CounterV2, and then back to CounterV1. examples/bin/upgrades_on_livenet.rs //! This example demonstrates how to deploy and upgrade a contract on the Livenet environment. use odra::casper_types::U256; use odra::host::{Deployer, HostRef, InstallConfig, NoArgs}; use odra_examples::features::upgrade::{CounterV1, CounterV2, CounterV2UpgradeArgs}; fn main() { let env = odra_casper_livenet_env::env(); env.set_gas(500_000_000_000u64); // Contracts can be upgraded let mut counter = CounterV1::deploy_with_cfg(&amp;env, NoArgs, InstallConfig::upgradable::&lt;CounterV1&gt;()); env.set_gas(50_000_000_000u64); counter.increment(); assert_eq!(counter.get(), 1); env.set_gas(500_000_000_000u64); let mut counter2 = CounterV2::try_upgrade( &amp;env, counter.contract_address(), CounterV2UpgradeArgs { new_start: None } ) .unwrap(); env.set_gas(50_000_000_000u64); counter2.increment(); assert_eq!(counter2.get(), U256::from(2)); env.set_gas(500_000_000_000u64); let mut counter3 = CounterV1::try_upgrade(&amp;env, counter.contract_address(), NoArgs).unwrap(); env.set_gas(50_000_000_000u64); counter3.increment(); assert_eq!(counter3.get(), 2); }  The Deployer trait has two functions that allow upgrading contracts: try_upgrade: upgrades a contract to a new version. It takes the environment, the address of the contract to be upgraded, and the arguments for the new version of the contract. The function try_upgrade_with_cfg: same as try_upgrade, but allows specifying a custom upgrade configuration. Let's take a quick look at the CounterV2 implementation: #[odra::module] impl CounterV2 { pub fn init(&amp;mut self, start_from: Option&lt;U256&gt;) { if let Some(start) = start_from { self.new_counter.set(start); } else { self.new_counter.set(U256::from(0)); } } pub fn upgrade(&amp;mut self, new_start: Option&lt;U256&gt;) { if let Some(start) = new_start { self.new_counter.set(start); } else { // If no new value is provided, we keep the current value self.new_counter.set(self.counter.get_or_default().into()); } } ... }  The contract implements the upgrade function, which allows executing the upgrade logic for the contract. When upgrading to a new version, the upgrade function is called with the new initialization parameters. We call the try_upgrade function with CounterV2UpgradeArgs - a struct automatically generated by the Odra framework. It is a mirror feature of the contract's initialization parameters.

OdraSolidity use odra::prelude::*; #[odra::module] pub struct HelloWorld { greet: Var&lt;String&gt;, } #[odra::module] impl HelloWorld { pub fn init(&amp;mut self, message: String) { self.greet.set(message); } pub fn get(&amp;self) -&gt; String { self.greet.get_or_default() } }  As you may have noticed, the Odra code is slightly more verbose than the Solidity code. To define a contract in Odra, you need to create a struct and implement a module for it, both annotated with the odra::module attribute. The struct contains the contract's state variables, while the module defines the contract's functions. In this example, the HelloWorld struct has a single state variable greet, which stores the greeting message. The module contains two functions: init to set the greeting message and get to retrieve it. Two key differences are: Odra does not generate getters for public state variables automatically, so you need to define them explicitly.To initialize values, you must do it in the init function, which is the contract constructor. You can't assign defaults outside the constructor.

Odra provides a wide range of integer types: u8, u16, u32, u64, U128, and U256 for unsigned integers, and i32 and i64 for signed integers. The Address type in Odra is used to represent account and contract addresses. In Odra, there is no default/zero value for the Address type; the workaround is to use Option&lt;Address&gt;. The Bytes type is used to store byte arrays. Values are stored in units called Named Keys and Dictionaries. Additionally, local variables are available within the entry points and can be used to perform necessary actions or computations within the scope of each entry point.

Constants are immutable and can be of any type, including custom types. In addition to constants, Solidity also supports the immutable keyword, which is used to set the value of a variable once, in the constructor. Further attempts to alter this value result in a compile error. Odra/Rust does not have an equivalent to Solidity's immutable keyword.

State variables are stored on the blockchain and are accessible by all functions within the contract. Local variables are not stored on the blockchain and are only available within the function in which they are declared. Global variables provide information about the blockchain. Odra uses very similar concepts, but with some differences. In Odra, state variables are a part of a module definition, and local variables are available within the entry points and can be used to perform necessary actions or computations within the scope of each entry point. Global variables are accessed using an instance of ContractEnv retrieved using the env() function.

As in Solidity, you must be aware that reading the entire array in one go can be expensive, so it's better to avoid it for large arrays. In many cases, you can use a Mapping or List instead of an array or vector to store data.

The enum can have a default value specified using the #[default] attribute if derived from the Default trait. The enum can be used as a state variable in a contract, and its value can be set and retrieved using the set and get functions. The value cannot be deleted; however, it can be set using the Default::default() function.

All functions are considered view functions by default, meaning they can read contract state but not modify it. To modify the state, the first parameter (called the receiver parameter) should be &amp;mut self. If you want to create a pure function that doesn't read or modify state, you can define it as a regular Rust function without any side effects.

Instead, you can define functions that perform certain actions before or after the main function logic. In the example above, the lock and unlock functions are called before and after the decrement function, respectively, but they must be called explicitly. As often as practicable, developers should inline functions by including the body of the function within their code using the #[inline] attribute.

The event struct can contain multiple fields, which can be of any type (primitive or custom Odra type). To emit an event, use the env's emit_event() function, passing the event struct as an argument. note Events in Solidity are used to emit logs that off-chain services can capture.

In Odra, there is only one way to revert the execution of a function - by using the env().revert() function. The function takes an error type as an argument and stops the execution of the function.

However, Odra and Rust follow a different paradigm known as composition. Instead of inheriting behavior from parent contracts, Odra encourages the composition of contracts by embedding one contract within another. Let's take a look at the difference between inheritance in Solidity and composition in Odra. OdraSolidity use odra::prelude::*; #[odra::module] pub struct A; #[odra::module] impl A { pub fn foo(&amp;self) -&gt; String { &quot;A&quot;.to_string() } } #[odra::module] pub struct B { a: SubModule&lt;A&gt; } #[odra::module] impl B { pub fn foo(&amp;self) -&gt; String { &quot;B&quot;.to_string() } } #[odra::module] pub struct C { a: SubModule&lt;A&gt; } #[odra::module] impl C { pub fn foo(&amp;self) -&gt; String { &quot;C&quot;.to_string() } } #[odra::module] pub struct D { b: SubModule&lt;B&gt;, c: SubModule&lt;C&gt; } #[odra::module] impl D { pub fn foo(&amp;self) -&gt; String { self.c.foo() } } #[odra::module] pub struct E { b: SubModule&lt;B&gt;, c: SubModule&lt;C&gt; } #[odra::module] impl E { pub fn foo(&amp;self) -&gt; String { self.b.foo() } } #[odra::module] pub struct F { a: SubModule&lt;A&gt;, b: SubModule&lt;B&gt;, } #[odra::module] impl F { pub fn foo(&amp;self) -&gt; String { self.a.foo() } }  Solidity supports both single and multiple inheritance. This means a contract can inherit from one or more contracts. Solidity uses a technique called &quot;C3 linearization&quot; to resolve the order in which base contracts are inherited in the case of multiple inheritance. This helps to ensure a consistent method resolution order. However, multiple inheritance can lead to complex code and potential issues, especially for inexperienced developers. In contrast, Rust does not have a direct equivalent to the inheritance model, but it achieves similar goals through composition. Each contract is defined as a struct, and contracts can be composed by embedding one struct within another. This approach provides a more flexible and modular way to reuse code and establish relationships between contracts.

In the sample code above, the Math library contains a square root function, while the Array library provides a function to remove an element from an array. Both libraries are consumed in different ways: the TestMath contract calls the sqrt function directly, while the TestArray contract uses the using keyword, which extends the type uint256[] by adding the remove function. In Odra, you use language-level features: modules and traits. The mod keyword defines a module, which is similar to a library in Solidity. Modules can contain functions, types, and other items that can be reused across multiple contracts. Traits are similar to interfaces in other programming languages, defining a set of functions that a type must implement. Implementing the Removable trait for the Var&lt;Vec&lt;U256&gt;&gt; type allows the remove function to be called on a variable that stores a vector of U256 values.

The try/catch statement allows developers to catch and handle exceptions that occur during external function calls and contract creation. In Odra, there is no direct equivalent to the try/catch statement in Solidity. However, you can use the Result type to handle errors in a similar way. The Result type is an enum that represents either success (Ok) or failure (Err). You can use the match statement to handle the Result type and execute different code based on the result. However, if an unexpected error occurs on the way, the whole transaction reverts.
