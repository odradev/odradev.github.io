# Delegating CSPR to Validators
Casper 2.0 introduced a feature, that allows delegating CSPR tokens to validators by contracts.
This can be useful, especially if you want to implement some kind of liquid staking solution.
That's why Odra since v2.0.0 provides a way to delegate CSPR tokens to validators by contracts.
