# Host Communication

One of the things that your contract will probably do is to query the host for some information -
what is the current time? Who called me? Following example shows how to do this:

```rust title="examples/src/features/host_functions.rs"
use odra::prelude::*;

#[odra::module]
pub struct HostContract {
    name: Var<String>,
    created_at: Var<u64>,
    created_by: Var<Address>
}

#[odra::module]
impl HostContract {
    pub fn init(&mut self, name: String) {
        self.name.set(name);
        self.created_at.set(self.env().get_block_time());
        self.created_by.set(self.env().caller())
    }

    pub fn name(&self) -> String {
        self.name.get_or_default()
    }
}
```

As you can see, we are using `self.env()`. It is an implementation of [`Module::env()`], autogenerated
by `#[odra::module]` attribute. The function returns a reference to the [`ContractEnv`] (you can read more in 
the [`Backend section`]). This is a structure that provides access to the host functions and variables. 

In this example, we use two of them:
* `get_block_time()` - returns the current block time as u64. 
* `caller()` - returns an Odra `Address` of the caller (this can be an external caller or another contract).

You will learn more functions that Odra exposes from host and types it uses in further articles.

In the next article, we'll dive into testing your contracts with Odra, so you can check that the code
we presented in fact works!
