# odra-examples
Odra repository provides rich source learning materials. We want to ensure you would feel comfortable with the framework from day one and make the learning curve as flat as possible. Are you a Solidity developer? Are you a Casper developer? Are you new to smart contracts development? To learn Odra from its creators, look at the `examples` in the [Odra main repository].

The examples we have prepared demonstrate in "real code" all the concepts you have read in this documentation, from a simple access control module ending up with a wallet where you can lock your native tokens for a certain amount of time.

Don't worry if you find learning solely by reading the code challenging. Go to the [Tutorial](../category/tutorials/) section, where we will review it together. We will break the code into pieces, leaving no space for further questions.

## What's next
Read the next article to learn about reusable Odra components encapsulated in `odra-modules`.
